Athlesuire is not seen as appropriate attire when going out and about for errands, your business casual attire is considered a norm and a basic standard throughout Italy, therefore plan your outfits accordingly. Running sneakers are not something to wear out with casual outfits so expect to stick out like a sore thumb if you wear running sneakers. Better yet, find yourself some fashionable yet comfortable boots or dress up shoes and you’ll be one step closer to adopting the Italian fashion as your own.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"image\": \"https://imagestravelblog.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/TYMKBVI_4/TYMKBVI_4_8.jpeg\",\n                \"subtext\": \"Window shopping in Como for men’s fashion\"\n                \n            },\n            {\n                \"image\": \"https://imagestravelblog.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/TYMKBVI_4/TYMKBVI_4_9.jpeg\",\n                \"subtext\": \"Window shopping in Como for women’s hats and accessories\"\n                \n            },\n            {\n                \"image\": \"https://imagestravelblog.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/TYMKBVI_4/TYMKBVI_4_10.jpeg\",\n                \"subtext\": \"Window shopping in Milan for men’s ties and business casual attire\"\n                \n            },\n            {\n                \"subHeading\": \"It’s very important to wear comfortable shoes\" \n            },\n            {\n                \"paragraph\": \"As a couple who loves to dress fashionably we understand shoes are an important part of any attire, but trust us on this one - prioritize comfort over fashion!
